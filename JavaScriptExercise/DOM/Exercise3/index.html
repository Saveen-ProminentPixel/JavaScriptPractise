            I left college laboratory, went to the park in front of college and sat on the bench and started thinking that I should try to get a job of teacher in a school. Prof. Ruchiram was coming from the Townhall wit a tennis racket in his hand. 
            Prof. Ruchiram was a senior professor in chemistry department. He has been retired by that time. Professor had helped me in many times. I will write about him in my education related articles.
